# Backtest Evidence Snapshot

These CSVs are copied from workspace backtest outputs for evidence/reference:

- `strategy_performance_metrics.csv` (settled trades metrics snapshot)
- `backtest_unfiltered_full.csv` (per-trade trigger/expiry ROI snapshot)

Note: results depend on strategy settings (cooldown/no-cooldown), data cutoff, and whether pending trades are included.
